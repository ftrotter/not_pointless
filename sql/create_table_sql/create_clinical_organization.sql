-- Organizations have lots of DBAs and brand names that require a many-to-one notation.. 
-- and we can define the whole concept of a higher level brand as a many-to-many name relationship..
-- If NUCC codes were reasonable, we could possibly do away with Organization Type as a seperate table.
-- But NUCC is so broken that I suspect in the future we are going to want to track data "just about SNFs"
-- JUst about Hospitals and just about FQHCs etc etc. Given that, having a org type that we control seems like an invaluable first step. 
-- Also want to clarify when I am talking about organizations that provide clinical care directly, as opposed to holding companies
-- which own clinical organizations but are not themselves clinical. Which strangely enough can also include payers.. 
-- TODO: discuss the clinical org, payer, and holding company question with Sarah and team.
