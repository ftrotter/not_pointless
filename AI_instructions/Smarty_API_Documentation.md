| suitelink_match | varchar(5) | Indicates a match (or not) to the USPS SuiteLink data. SuiteLink attempts to provide secondary information such as "suite" or "apartment" whenever there is a match based on address and company name.<br><br>true — There was a SuiteLink match and the result is provided.<br>(e.g.,Columbia, 3700 Cabela's Blvd Lehi UT 84043)<br>false — There was no SuiteLink match. |
| enhanced_match | varchar(64) | When an address is submitted with the match parameter set to "enhanced," this field will contain additional information about the result. Multiple values may be present, separated by commas. Additional values will be added from time to time.

 ## Footnotes Table

This table describes possible values in the footnotes field from the analysis object.

| Value | Definition | Details |
|-------|------------|---------|
| A# | Corrected ZIP Code | The address was found to have a different 5-digit ZIP Code than the one submitted. The correct ZIP Code is shown in the zipcode field.<br>(e.g., 4800 Fairmount Ave Kansas City MO 64111) |
| B# | Corrected city/state spelling | The spelling of the city name and/or state abbreviation in the submitted address was found to be different than the standard spelling. The standard spellings are shown in the city_name and state_abbreviation fields.<br>(e.g., 370 Main St, Frenchville, ME 04756) |
| C# | Invalid city/state/ZIP | The ZIP Code in the submitted address could not be found because neither a valid city and state, nor valid 5-digit ZIP Code was present. Smarty recommends that the customer check the accuracy of the submitted address.<br>(e.g., 200 Camp Drive 25816) |
| D# | No ZIP+4 assigned | This address is not present in the USPS data. Smarty recommends that the customer check the accuracy of the submitted address.<br>(e.g., 2288 S Bethel Ave Sanger, CA 93657) |
| E# | Same ZIP for multiple | Multiple records were returned, with the same 5-digit ZIP Code. |
| F# | Address not found | The address, exactly as submitted, could not be found in the city, state, or ZIP Code provided. Some possible reasons for this are: the primary number is missing, the street is missing, or the street is too badly misspelled to understand<br>(e.g., 2600 Rafe Lane Jackson MS 39201) |
| G# | Used addressee data | Information in the addressee input field was determined to be part of the address. It was moved out of the addressee field and incorporated into the street field.<br>(e.g., 97 Taylor St apt 3F Taylor Manchester NH) |
| H# | Missing secondary number | The address as submitted is missing a secondary number (apartment, suite, etc.). Smarty recommends that the customer check the accuracy of the submitted address and add the missing secondary number to ensure the correct Delivery Point Barcode (DPBC).<br>(e.g., 109 Wimbledon Sq Chesapeake VA 23320) |
| I# | Insufficient/ incorrect address data | More than one ZIP+4 Code was found to satisfy the address as submitted. The submitted address did not contain sufficiently complete or correct data to determine a single ZIP+4 Code. Smarty recommends that the customer check the accuracy and completeness of the submitted address. For example, a street may have a similar address at both the north and south ends of the street. |
| J# | Dual address | The input contained two addresses. For example: 123 MAIN ST PO BOX 99.<br>(e.g., PO Box 38606 30th Street Train Station Philadelphia PA 19104) |
| K# | Cardinal rule match | Although the address as submitted is not valid, we were able to find a match by changing the cardinal direction (North, South, East, West). The cardinal direction we used to find a match is found in the components.<br>(e.g., 315 W Cesar Chavez St Austin TX) |
| L# | Changed address component | An address component (i.e., directional or suffix only) was added, changed, or deleted in order to achieve a match.<br>(e.g., 213 S QUANAH RUSSELLVILLE AR 72801) |
| LL# or LI# | Flagged address for LACSLink | The input address matched a record that was LACS-indicated, that was submitted to LACSLink for processing. This does not mean that the address was converted; it only means that the address was submitted to LACSLink because the input address had the LACS indicator set. |
| M# | Corrected street spelling | The spelling of the street name was changed in order to achieve a match. |
| N# | Fixed abbreviations | The delivery address was standardized. For example, if STREET was in the delivery address, Smarty will return ST as its standard spelling. |
| O# | Multiple ZIP+4; lowest used | More than one ZIP+4 Code was found to satisfy the address as submitted. The lowest ZIP+4 add-on may be used to break the tie between the records.<br>(e.g., 313 E 3 St Nescopeck PA 18635) |
| P# | Better address exists | The delivery address is matchable, but it is known by another (preferred) name. For example, in New York, NY, AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS is also known as 6TH AVE. An inquiry using a delivery address of 39 6th Avenue would be flagged with Footnote P#. If the given address is acceptable (meaning it is the same as the preferred version), then it will not be changed and the footnote will be returned (e.g., 7202 Panam Expy S San Antonio TX 78224). If the input address is unacceptable (meaning it is recognized but not the preferred version), then it will be changed to the preferred version and the footnote is returned (e.g., 131 Stone Farm Lebanon NH 03766) |
| Q# | Unique ZIP match | The address has a "unique" ZIP Code<br>(e.g., 645 Swick Hill Street Charlotte NC 28263) |
| R# | No match; EWS: Match soon | The delivery address is not yet matchable, but the US Postal Service Early Warning System file indicates that a match will be available soon. |
| S# | Unrecognized secondary address | The secondary information (apartment, suite, etc.) was not recognized as part of the USPS data.<br>(e.g., 1409 Hueytown Rd Apt 1781 Bessemer AL 35023) |
| T# | Multiple response due to magnet street syndrome | The search resulted in a single response; however, the record matched was flagged as having magnet street syndrome, and the input street name components (pre-directional, primary street name, post-directional, and suffix) did not exactly match those of the record. A "magnet street" is one having a primary street name that is also a suffix or directional word, having either a post-directional or a suffix (i.e., 2220 PARK MEMPHIS TN logically matches to a ZIP+4 record 2200-2258 PARK AVE MEMPHIS TN 38114-6610), but the input address lacks the suffix "AVE" which is present on the ZIP+4 record. The primary street name "PARK" is a suffix word. The record has either a suffix or a post-directional present. Therefore, in accordance with CASS requirements, a ZIP+4 Code must not be returned. The multiple response return code is given since a "no match" would prevent the best candidate.<br>(e.g., 84 Green St Northampton MA) |
| U# | Unofficial city name | The city name in the submitted address is an alternate city name that is not accepted by the US Postal Service. The preferred city name is output in the city_name field.<br>(e.g., 150 Ken Visage Ln LaFayette GA) |
| V# | Unverifiable city/state | The city and state in the submitted address could not be verified as corresponding to the given 5-digit ZIP Code. This comment does not necessarily denote an error; however, Smarty recommends that the customer check the accuracy of the city and state in the submitted address.<br>(e.g., 7210 17 Avenue New York NY 11204 |
| W# | Invalid delivery address | The USPS does not provide street delivery service for this ZIP Code. The USPS requires the use of a PO Box, General Delivery, or Postmaster for delivery within this ZIP Code. |
| X# | Default Unique ZIP Code | The address has a "unique" ZIP Code with a default ZIP+4 code<br>(e.g., 2020 S LAND OLAKES BLVD APT 9 FORT WORTH TX 76199 |
| Y# | Military match | The address has a military or diplomatic ZIP Code.<br>(e.g., PSC 10 Box 1324 APO AE 09142) |
| Z# | Matched with ZIPMOVE | The ZIPMOVE product shows which ZIP+4 records have moved from one ZIP Code to another. If an input address matches a ZIP+4 record which the ZIPMOVE product indicates has moved, the search is performed again in the new ZIP Code.<br>(e.g., 26131 State Highway 37 Seligman MO 65745) |
