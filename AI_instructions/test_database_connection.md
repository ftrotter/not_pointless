Test DB connection
==================

I have started a Django app, but I need to verify that I can talk to the database.
I have included the password to the dataase in the .env file and I believe I have otherwise correctly configured
not_pointless/settings.py
in order to connect to the AWS hosted postgres instance. I have connected successfully from
my local machine DB GUI to this instance and I have added some data. I need to verify that my locally running development
version of this Django app has access to this same database.

I have a schema on the database defined as:

CREATE TABLE endpoint
(
    id           INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY
        PRIMARY KEY,
    endpoint_url TEXT,
    domain_name  TEXT,
    created_at   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This table is inside the not_pointless schema in the 'postgres' database.

I would like to simply verify that django can connect to this database.

Lets create an ORM class for the table, and then use that ORM to create a simple html5 homepage for the DJango app that simply lists out the distinct URLs.

All of this should be done underneath the current "not_pointless" INSTALLED_APP.
